HOW TO PLAY: 
1) Think of a word and then answer each question with a 'Y' or 'N' (meaning Yes or No), the game will then try to guess what you are thinking of.
2) If the game doesn't guess what you are thinking of it will prompt you to type your answer in to the question, which will update the file.

BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE:
> The 'big' file contains many Questions and Answers and is a couple thousand lines of prompts, it gets updated everytime a user thinks of something not in that file
> You can also make a blank file and run the game with it and update the file as you go, although it may take a really long time to get a sufficiently-sized file to play with that way.
